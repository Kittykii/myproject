    Ice-cream</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(183, 134, 162);">What is ice-cream??</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(19, 18, 18);font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Ice cream is a mixture of milk, cream, sugar, and
    sometimes other ingredients that has been frozen into a soft,
    creamy delight using special techniques. Ice cream has been a popular treat for hundreds of years but has only
    become commonplace since the widespread use of refrigeration. The exploding popularity
    of ice cream has led to a number of ice-cream variations including frozen custard, frozen yogurt,
    and even non-dairy versions made with ingredients like coconut milk.</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(194, 150, 186);">Ice Cream Composition</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(18, 17, 17);font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">
    In the United States, ice cream must contain 10 to 16 percent milk fat. Higher milk fat ice creams generally have a
    smoother texture because they contain a lower amount of water and, therefore, fewer ice crystals. Ice creams that
    contain less than 10% milkfat are referred to as "ice milk" or more popularly, "low fat" ice cream.

    In addition to milk or cream, ice cream often contains stabilizers, like gluten, to help keep the mixture a
    consistent texture. Sugar or sugar substitutes are usually added to provide the sweet flavor that most people
    expect. No-sugar-added varieties of ice cream have become popular and rely on the addition of fruit and milk's
    natural sugars for their subtle sweetness.

    The variety of flavors and additives in ice cream has kept its popularity strong with consumers. From tropical
    fruits like mango or less common ones like pomegranate to unconventional flavors like coffee or basil, thousands of
    ice-cream flavors, both savory and sweet, have been created over the years.</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(208, 154, 190);">How Ice Cream Is Made</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(18, 17, 17);font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">If you place a container of milk or cream in the
    freezer, you'll end up with a stiff block of frozen liquid, not the soft, creamy ice cream that we're used to.
    Special techniques are employed to make ice cream that creates smaller ice crystals and incorporates air, which
    produces a soft texture.

    Constantly churning ice cream, whether by hand or mechanically, ensures that large, stiff ice crystals do not form
    within the mixture. The churning process also serves to introduce air and create a foam-like texture, further
    softening the mixture. However, there are no-churn options to make ice cream.

    Salt, which lowers the melting point of ice, is often used in the ice-cream making process. When the melting point
    of ice is lowered, it draws heat out from the ice-cream mixture faster, causing it to freeze at a quicker rate.
    Freezing the mixture quickly produces smaller ice crystals and a softer final product. The salt that is mixed with
    the ice never comes in contact with the ice cream and therefore does not affect the sodium content. The salt-filled
    ice is packed around an inner ice-cream chamber that keeps the ice cream in and salt out.

    Liquid nitrogen and dry ice can also be used to make ice cream as they also produce a quick freezing action. The
    popular mall treat Dippin Dots consists of small balls of ice cream created using liquid nitrogen to freeze small
    droplets of cream.</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(217, 153, 195);">How to Store Ice Cream</h1>
<h1 style="color:rgb(18, 17, 17);font-size:20px; text-align: justify;">Ice cream should be kept as cold as possible
    during its transport from the store to home. The process of melting and refreezing can create large ice crystals and
    reduce its smooth texture, making it hard to scoop and giving it an odd feel.

    Store ice cream in the main compartment of your freezer, rather than the door, to make sure it stays well below its
    freezing point. Items in the freezer door are repeatedly exposed to warmer air when the door is opened, which can
    cause a thaw and refreeze cycle and lower the texture quality of the ice cream.

    To prevent ice crystals and rogue flavors from absorbing into your ice cream after opening, simply press a piece of
    plastic wrap onto the surface of the ice cream and then replace the lid. This will provide a barrier from air and
    moisture while it is stored in the freezer. For the best flavor and texture, consume ice cream within a month of
    purchase.</h1>
